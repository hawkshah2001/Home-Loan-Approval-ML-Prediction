A study on home loan prediction was conducted using a dataset from Dream Housing Finance Company, focusing on various socio-economic factors influencing loan approvals. The dataset comprised 13 independent variables, including demographic, financial, and property details. The data underwent visualization and preparation, followed by analysis using three classification models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.

Initial benchmarks highlighted skewed data, leading to the use of the median for data filling and the removal of biased features. Preprocessing steps included resampling with SMOTE to balance the data and improve model accuracy. Among the models, Decision Trees proved to be the most effective after adjustments.

The study provides insights into the determinants of home loan approvals, offering valuable implications for business managers and future research in the field of home financing.
